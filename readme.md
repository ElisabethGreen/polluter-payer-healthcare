I am actively seeking collaborators to develop a minimally viable product from the user interface I coded at https://github.com/elisabethgreen/polluter-payer-healthcare/blob/main/pay.htm which trades data for payment in carbon offsets or food vouchers. The calculator at https://github.com/elisabethgreen/ detects when the user has lifetime environmental credit to spend on healthcare and food.
Links to the index page https://github.com/elisabethgreen/polluter-payer-healthcare/index.htm should include any app or dapp up for beta test.
