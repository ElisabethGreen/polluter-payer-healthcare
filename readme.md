I am actively seeking collaborators to develop a minimally viable product that estimates a breathing individual's environmental impact and rewards her in proportion to her environmental protection. The rewards may include 3-way swaps that transfer credit, data, housing, healthcare, etc.
The user stores encrypted all of her personal and corporate documents to prove her environmental impact through a portal like the one I coded at https://github.com/elisabethgreen/polluter-payer-healthcare/blob/main/pay.htm which I posted at http://green247.org/pay.htm on my website.
Her environmental impact is then calculated using the comprehensive lifetime environmental impact calculator which I coded at https://github.com/ElisabethGreen/impact/blob/main/impact.htm and posted at http://green247.org/calculator.htm and am updating.
A ledger detects when the user has lifetime environmental credit to spend on healthcare and other needs.
